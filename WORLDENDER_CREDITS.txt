	* All meshes and skins were derived from assets in the https://tribesrpg.org/ Repack!

	* This mod uses community assets built up over the years exclusively!
	  The only reason I was able to develop this mod in two months' time is due to the
	  wonderful, massive quantity of assets gathered up over the years. I earnestly
	  wouldn't know who to begin to credit and implore you to seek credits within
	  the TribesRPG org's Repack itself.

	* The audio files for World Ender will change! At the moment, the vast majority of
	  "new" sounds are placeholders intended to generate a basic sense of atmosphere.
	  They will be replaced with more appriate choices all around in future versions.
	  Credits will be updated when this situation is stable -- but most sound effects
	  are from the original mod!
