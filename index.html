<p style="background: rgba(15,1,25,0.3);"><font size=4pt>
In "World Ender", Keldrin's waters are running dry, but nobody knows why. The Druids have moved from their town of Wellsprings to their new home of Oasis. The Wizards retreated to Wyzanhyde - after shutting down the weather machines at Delkin Heights; freezing Overville; and blocking off the Dig Site. Thinking that shutting down the weather devices would slow the drying of the water was wrong - a thick, dark fog descended as the last device was powered off. Churls, Imps and demons burst through the earth from the Undercity. Gnolls seized an opportunity to move into Old Ethren. Minotaurs and Ratman took over castle ruins. Natives turned to savages as the Luminous Dawn's Newcomers pushed them out of their territory. The residents of Wellsprings went mad drinking the water, calling themselves Wildenslayers. And, the Ancients awoke.
</p><p style="background: rgba(15,1,25,0.3);">
The Mandate is the only form of order left in Keldrin - and with no jailing system, they can't handle much. If someone is able to clear the skies and smith The Equalizer, the world might end. The citizens and Order of Qod see this as inevitable, but the College of Geoastrics' head Refractor Pryzm knows it's all nonsense. The world wasn't always flat. Her students are researching a way to control the rain and achieve resonance at scale - something Wordsmiths can already do with small chunks of ore. If they can control the portals on Keldrin, why can't they restore a link with the space rock this land mass was cut from?
</p><p style="background: rgba(15,1,25,0.3);">
Newcomers who don't get lost at the Restaurant at the End of the World tend to fall off the edge. Qod catches those who die with FAVOR, while Zatan toys with the rest. But it hardly matters. As a Newcomer, you don't know any of this. You're thirsty. There's not much water. Someone gave you a Hatchet and some parchment. Everyone wants to talk, but nobody knows what's going on. Which faction do you join? Do you care about the end of the world? Do you help it along, or try to stop it?
</p></font>
<center><h2 class="softblack">Will you end Keldrin and start a new cycle?<br/><br/>...or work to keep this cycle from ending?</h1></center>

<tr class="skills"><td>Luck</td><td>All Newcomers begin luckless. Luck influences the chance that enemies will drop their weapons when killed, and increases the quantities of other items they drop as well. Luck cannot be "trained", and cannot exceed a 50% influence rate.</td></tr>
<tr class="skills"><td>Governing Skills</td><td>Strength, Endurance, Focus and Willpower all have a strong effect on other skills. Druids that forget about Focus will find themselves casting spells slowly. Clerics that forget about Strength won't deal much damage and won't wear good armor.</td></tr>
<tr class="skills"><td>Thirst</td><td>Thirst impacts your health and mana regeneration. At low levels, the effect won't be noticable. At high levels, your Vitality and Energy will begin to work against you very quickly. You can drink from any river or pool by jumping in, or carry water with you in a variety of flasks. Mages who expect to be poor may wish to intentionally limit their Energy pool in order to avoid the negative impacts of thirst...</td></tr>
<tr class="skills"><td>FAVOR</td><td>FAVOR is required to seal items, protects against death, and will allow players to survive when the world begins to end. It is required to seal items and hide coins with Sealbrokers and serves a variety of other purposes.</td></tr>
<tr class="skills"><td>Death</td><td>Players retain their items if they die with FAVOR. Without favour, your items will be sealed. Should you die and be captured without FAVOR, you may need to die repeatedly in order to enter the Hall of Souls and obtain your equipment again...</td></tr>
<tr class="skills"><td>Hall of Souls</td><td>A quiet place where dead souls collect. Unless the world is ending, you may leave the Hall of Souls through several doors that lead to various places in Keldrin. Those who do not fear death may use this to their advantage...</td></tr>
<tr class="skills"><td>Capture</td><td>Players without favour might be discovered by outlaws, revived, and sold to the highest bidder. If this happens, you'll need to use your wits to escape.</td></tr>
<tr class="skills"><td>Jail</td><td>The justice system of Keldrin is in tatters. Those caught by Mandatories will be jailed for their crimes, but everyone else will go free.</td></tr>

<tr class="skills"><td>Bounty</td><td>Functions the same as in Tribes RPG. Thieves acquire a bounty which can be cashed in by their killer.</td></tr>
<tr class="skills"><td>Pickpocketing</td><td>Since players do not drop items when dead, your items are effectively lost to a thief once stolen. You can, however, recover the full value of your items in coin by killing the Thief yourself. In this instance, the coins won't be shared with other victims -- you'll get the full value of everything the thief stole!</td></tr>

<tr class="skills"><td>Keepers</td><td>These Ancients hold the key to smithing the best weapons in Keldrin. They can be found at strange ruins all around Keldrin, and might have something interesting for sale...</td></tr>
<tr class="skills"><td>Enemies</td><td>Combat is now full of surprises. The enemies will use all of the same skills and spells you have access to! They will heal and buff their allies, charge at you, cast radstorms, hide, and more! You'll need to scout areas and pick your targets wisely, or get used to calling the Hall of Souls home.</td></tr>
